Example repository of my preferred tech stack for a web service, with or without a frontend. Meaningfull choices:
 * Connect to Postgres DB
 * Backend runs in docker container
 * Data backups stored in AWS
 * Typescript/node backend
 * GitHub Actions for CI/CD
 * GitHub Packages for artifacts
 * Kubernetes for app scalability and availability
